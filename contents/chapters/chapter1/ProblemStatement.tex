\section{Problem Statement}
Healthcare providers today face numerous challenges with existing management systems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Outdated, manual processes lead to inefficiencies and delays in patient service.
    \item Current systems lack scalability and struggle to handle growing amounts of patient data.
    \item Legacy solutions are resource-intensive and do not support remote accessibility or real-time updates.
    \item Inefficient data handling results in increased operational costs and diminished patient experience.
\end{itemize}
