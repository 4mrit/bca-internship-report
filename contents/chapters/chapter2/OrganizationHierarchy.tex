\section{Organizational Hierarchy}
SolveeTech maintains a well-defined organizational hierarchy which ensures clear communication and efficient decision-making. At the top is the CEO, supported by a team of senior managers and department heads. Each department, such as Software Development, Marketing, and Administration, functions with its own leadership while working together towards common company goals. This structure not only ensures smooth day-to-day operations but also provides clear paths for career development and accountability throughout the organization.
