\section{Description of Intern Department/Unit}
Interns at SolveeTech are primarily integrated into the Software Development Department. This unit is organized into small teams, each focused on different aspects of the development life cycle, including front-end design, back-end programming, and quality assurance. Interns work closely with experienced professionals, participate in project meetings, and contribute to real coding tasks. This hands-on experience is designed to develop technical skills, enhance problem-solving abilities, and provide a clear insight into industry best practices. The supportive environment not only accelerates learning but also prepares interns for a successful career in the technology sector.
