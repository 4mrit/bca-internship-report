\section{Description of the Project(s) Involved During Internship}
The primary project in which I was involved was the development and deployment of a SAAS-based Hospital Management System at SolveeTech Pvt. Ltd. This project aimed to modernize conventional hospital management practices by providing a cloud-based solution that simplifies patient data management and enhances operational efficiency. 

Key contributions I made include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item mplementing SaaS solutions requires adhering to best practices that ensure scalability and security \cite{miller2019survey, techdeployment2021}.
  \item Developing scalable data management features that allow for the addition, update, and deletion of patient records.
  \item Integrating interactive elements to support an enhanced user experience for both healthcare staff and patients.
  \item Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to ensure that the final product aligned with industry best practices and customer needs.
\end{itemize}

Overall, working on this project has provided me with a deeper understanding of modern SAAS architectures, agile methodologies, and the practical challenges involved in deploying critical software systems in a dynamic, real-world environment.
