\chapter*{Abstract}
This report, titled \pgfkeysvalueof{/Project/title}, documents the design, development, and deployment of a SAAS-based Hospital Management System (HMS) at SolveeTech Pvt. Ltd. Developed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the \pgfkeysvalueof{/Project/degree} program, this project was undertaken at \pgfkeysvalueof{/Project/institute/university} – \pgfkeysvalueof{/Project/institute/faculty} of \pgfkeysvalueof{/Project/institute/college}, located in \pgfkeysvalueof{/Project/institute/address}. 

The system leverages modern cloud-based technologies to provide a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution for managing hospital operations, including patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing, and comprehensive reporting. Under the guidance of \pgfkeysvalueof{/Project/mentor/name} (\pgfkeysvalueof{/Project/mentor/title}) at \pgfkeysvalueof{/Project/mentor/institution}, the project integrates industry best practices and innovative software development methodologies. 

Through a structured development process—encompassing thorough system analysis, iterative design, and rigorous testing—the deployed HMS not only enhances operational efficiency but also significantly improves user experience for patients, hospital staff, and administrators. This work establishes a robust framework for future enhancements in digital healthcare solutions and contributes valuable insights into the application of SAAS-based models in the medical domain.
